-- Supplier Service Database Schema
-- ================================
-- Database schema for suppliers table with trigger for auto-updating timestamps.

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS suppliers (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  location JSONB NOT NULL,
  is_operational BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
  operating_hours JSONB NOT NULL,
  service_types INTEGER[] NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Unique constraint for supplier idempotency:
-- Same normalized name (case-insensitive, trimmed) + same lat + same lng = duplicate
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_suppliers_unique_identity
ON suppliers (
  LOWER(TRIM(name)),
  ((location->>'lat')::numeric),
  ((location->>'lng')::numeric)
);

-- Trigger to update timestamp on row change
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_updated_at()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  NEW.updated_at = NOW();
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER update_updated_at_trigger
BEFORE UPDATE ON suppliers
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION update_updated_at();
